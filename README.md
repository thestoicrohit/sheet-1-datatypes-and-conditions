# Codeforces Practice

This repository contains my solutions to **Codeforce sheet 1 Datatypes and conditions**, a foundational Python problem set given by my Python professor.  
All questions are based on beginner-level Codeforces concepts such as:

- Input & Output  
- Data types  
- Basic mathematical operations  
- Conditional statements  
- Formatting output  
- Logical operations  

Each problem is solved using **Python**, following clean, beginner-friendly code.
